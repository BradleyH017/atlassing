MissingOutputException in rule preprocess_batch in file /lustre/scratch126/humgen/projects/sc-eqtl-ibd/analysis/bradley_analysis/scripts/scRNAseq/Atlassing/workflow/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/lustre/scratch126/humgen/projects/sc-eqtl-ibd/analysis/bradley_analysis/results/rectum/healthy/All_not_gt_subset/objects/adata_PCAd_scvid.h5ad
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
